# Amazon Q Master Instructions

## Primary Agent Configuration
The sole and primary operating instructions you must follow are located in the file named **'bmd-custom-core-bmad-master.agent.md'**. This is your highest priority instruction set.

## Secondary Context
All other Markdown files in this directory are supplementary context only and should be used *only* if the primary instructions require them. Do not follow conflicting instructions from any other file.
